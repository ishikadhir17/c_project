**Project 1 is a computer-based game designed to challenge players'**
 i.ability to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts. 
**beginning ** 
           The game begins with the computer selecting a random number within a predefined range. Players then input their guesses. 
**output**
          The computer provides feedback, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The objective is for the player to use the feedback to refine their subsequent guesses strategically, aiming to identify the correct number within the fewest attempts possible. 
          
       This project not only tests players' numerical intuition and problem-solving skills but also introduces concepts of randomness and algorithmic thinking.
